## Introspection of `coroutineContext`

### Description: 
To support the threading framework of IntelliJ, 
we need to cooperate with kotlin coroutines better than they allow it by default.

One example of this cooperation is an ability to get coroutine context from non-suspending places.
Essentially, we put the coroutine context into a thread local variable on every coroutine resumption, 
which allows us to read necessary information without a significant change in semantics. 
This change has a mild performance penalty, namely, modification of a thread local variable. 
However, coroutines themselves use thread local states via `ThreadLocalContextElement`, which hints that 
one more thread local variable would not harm.

### API:

We provide a single method `kotlinx.coroutines.internal.intellij.IntellijCoroutines.currentThreadCoroutineContext`.
The invariant is that the result of this method is always equal to `coroutineContext` in suspending environment, 
and it does not change during the non-suspending execution within the same thread.


## Parallelism compensation for `CoroutineDispatcher`s

If `runBlocking` happens to be invoked on a thread from `CoroutineDispatcher`, it may cause a thread starvation problem
(Kotlin#3983). This happens because `runBlocking` does not release an associated computational permit while it parks the
thread. To fix this, a parallelism compensation mechanism is introduced. When `runBlocking` decides to park a 
`CoroutineDispatcher` thread, it first increases the allowed parallelism limit of the `CoroutineDispatcher`. After
the thread unparks, `runBlocking` notifies the dispatcher that the parallelism limit should be lowered back. It is 
important that the effective parallelism may temporarily exceed the current allowed parallelism limit. The
`CoroutineDispatcher`'s worker take care of adjusting the effective parallelism if it needs to be decreased.

It is easy to see that this behavior cannot be general for `CoroutineDispatcher`s, at least because it breaks the contract
of `LimitedDispatcher` (one that can be acquired via `.limitedParallelism`). It means that parallelism compensation
cannot work for `LimitedDispatcher`, so `runBlocking` can still cause starvation issues there, but it seems rather 
expected.

Parallelism compensation support is internal and is implemented for `Dispatchers.Default` and `Dispatchers.IO`.
To acquire an analogue of `limitedParallelism` dispatcher which supports parallelism compensation, use 
`IntellijCoroutines.softLimitedParallelism`. Be advised that not every `.limitedParallelism` call can be substituted
with `.softLimitedParallelism`, e.g., `.limitedParallelism(1)` may be used as a synchronization manager and in this case
exceeding the parallelism limit would eliminate this (likely expected) side effect.

### API
- `CoroutineDispatcher.softLimitedParallelism` â€“ an analogue of `.limitedParallelism` which supports
  parallelism compensation
